# The purpose of this text document is to keep a time track of the progress of the project

* 7th May, 2017

This document was started. The report has been mostly prepared, with details about some projects left to be filled. Some projects, as listed in the file projects.txt have been discussed with Bill and Indrani Medhi Thies. The team has decided to start working on a project which exposes the truth of the Status Quo. So we have decided to track waste items - description present in ideas folder, in a file called BBMP_survey_Project_WriteUp.

We have been doing some searching online for getting a cheap GPS+GPRS device for tracking the coordinates of waste items we dispose. We have failed to find options cheaper than Rs. 1000/- that can be delivered in India. So today, I and Apurv went to a local Electronics market on SP Road but could only find options costing around Rs. 1700/-. The popular shops that provided these options were Vishal Electronics and Om Electronics. 

We also got contact of another store called Bluetronics, which we have contacted through email, providing our requirements.

In a discussion with Sambhav Satija (on 8th May), we realised that we can do away with the GPS component (priced at least 800 rupees) and just use the cell information from the GSM component to retrieve the approximate location of the device - expected error ~200 meters. We also discussed an even cheaper method which requires collaboration with BBMP, in which we can use radio beacons which can transmit radio signals to around 1-2 km. A GPS+GPRS device can be attached to all of the BBMP trucks and other picking vehicles and more accurate data can be fetched.

I and Apurv pitched Sambhav's ideas to Vivek and we have decided to go on with it. By today evening, I created an app which can list down the signal strengths along with the cell IDs and LACs of all the towers it can sense. The next step is to setup a server which can receive either SMS or HTTP packets from this app and track its location without using GPS.
