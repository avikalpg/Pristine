# The purpose of this text document is to keep a time track of the progress of the project

* 7th May, 2017

This document was started. The report has been mostly prepared, with details about some projects left to be filled. Some projects, as listed in the file projects.txt have been discussed with Bill and Indrani Medhi Thies. The team has decided to start working on a project which exposes the truth of the Status Quo. So we have decided to track waste items - description present in ideas folder, in a file called BBMP_survey_Project_WriteUp.

We have been doing some searching online for getting a cheap GPS+GPRS device for tracking the coordinates of waste items we dispose. We have failed to find options cheaper than Rs. 1000/- that can be delivered in India. So today, I and Apurv went to a local Electronics market on SP Road but could only find options costing around Rs. 1700/-. The popular shops that provided these options were Vishal Electronics and Om Electronics. 

We also got contact of another store called Bluetronics, which we have contacted through email, providing our requirements.

In a discussion with Sambhav Satija (on 8th May), we realised that we can do away with the GPS component (priced at least 800 rupees) and just use the cell information from the GSM component to retrieve the approximate location of the device - expected error ~200 meters. We also discussed an even cheaper method which requires collaboration with BBMP, in which we can use radio beacons which can transmit radio signals to around 1-2 km. A GPS+GPRS device can be attached to all of the BBMP trucks and other picking vehicles and more accurate data can be fetched.

I and Apurv pitched Sambhav's ideas to Vivek and we have decided to go on with it. By today evening, I created an app which can list down the signal strengths along with the cell IDs and LACs of all the towers it can sense. The next step is to setup a server which can receive either SMS or HTTP packets from this app and track its location without using GPS.

I came back from a tour to the USA, and during this time we received the GPS trackers we had ordered. These devices work using the GSM module and the manufacturers said that they provide the following functionalities:
1. If you send it a message "6660000", it will send back its lattitude and longitude.
2. If you send it a message "8880000", it will send back a google maps link to its position.
3. You can track it real time using the app and/or the website provided with the product, given that internet works in the SIM card inserted in the device.
Sadly none of these features work and the only useful thing that the tracker does is to send the cell-id (lac, mcc and mnc) of the (hopefully nearest) cell tower it is able to receive signals from. So we have sent emails to the manufacturers about this defect and also parallely started working on an Android app which can use whatever devices we have received to track garbage. Currently it is able to send and receive messages from the phone it is installed on.
