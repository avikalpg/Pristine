1.Make it easier for people to segregate waste.
	a.How hard is it to begin with? What are the confusing items? What is the right place to put composite waste products like tea bags? Is organic product in dry waste easier to treat or vice-versa?
	b.How can we train the public to be able to classify dry/wet/hazardous waste from each other? Is it more feasible to train the public or to make a technological solution like a smart bin?

2.Incentivize people to segregate waste - see how people respond to such an intervention.
	a.To what extent do we want them to segregate their waste (minimum 2-3 categories {dry, wet and hazardous, but what is the upper limit. If they do segregate to such larger extents, then our transportation costs will also rise.)

3.For just dry waste:
	a.Automatic segregation of different types of dry-waste (based on site/nature of recycle or re-use)
	b.Finding out the materials which are frequently disposed but do not have any recycling/re-use procedure in literature -- what can we do about it?
		i.What can be done to them immediately? (incinerate?)
		ii.What can be done in the long term? (laws to come up with degrade techniques to be able to start its manufacturing, or doing ad hoc research to either recycle, reuse or transform these kind of products, etc.)

Project Ideas:

1. (Credits: Vivek Seshadri) We can stick a GPS+GPRS stick to some samples of different kinds of wastes (cardboards, papers, plastic, electronic, metal, glass ... and if possible even to wet waste in some manner) and track their positions after the BBMP trucks collect them to actually analyse what happens to the waste collected by BBMP (at least from one particular area). Our current assumption is that some amount of the waste is being responsibly handled - as per the reports of the BBMP website, but most of the waste is mixed upon collection from the producers and then dumped in some nearby village.

2. We can start a survey of some sort to understand how aware and how much willing to pay is a person (living in slums of bangalore) for solving his/her own waste management problems. We currently are assuming that they don't want to pay anything because their default method is zero cost, in which they just throw their waste outside their own houses. We also assume that they have little to no knowledge about how harmful is the unmanaged waste for them, their children and the earth. Such a survey should also happen for people in other walks of life.

3. Smart bin technology. (Yet to do the back-ground work for this). We first need to figure out the whole mapping of day-to-day waste to the appropriate bin that should be used. Once this is prepared, we can work on the following projects:
	a) Some people have already worked on and made incentive based public dustbins. One project can be to test its success.
	b) We can work on technology to come up with a design to reduce the cost of a hybrid dustbin which has one mouth and 3 (or more) stomachs - wet, dry and hazardous, for household and public places' use.
