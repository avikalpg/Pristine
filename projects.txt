Project Ideas:

1. (Credits: Vivek Seshadri) 
	What:
		Find out what is the current status of waste management in Bangalore.
	How:
		We can stick a GPS+GPRS stick to some samples of different kinds of wastes (cardboards, papers, plastic, electronic, metal, glass ... and if possible even to wet waste in some manner) and track their positions after the BBMP trucks collect them.
	Why:
		To analyse what really happens to the waste collected by BBMP (at least from one particular area). Our current assumption is that some amount of the waste is being responsibly handled - as per the reports of the BBMP website, but most of the waste is mixed upon collection from the producers and then dumped in some nearby village.

2. 
	What:
		Design of a large trash can that can installed in a local house-hold.
	How:
		We start with answering the following questions:
			a) What is the best way of handling wet waste? Composting/bio-fuel/something else?
			b) What level of segregation is ideal for dry waste?
			c) How to handle hazardous waste?
		We decide an overall dimension of the bin based on weekly garbage production of a general house, and make partitions on the basis of the answers to the above questions and the general composition of the waste produced.
	Why:
		This design can be used to make dustbins for any responsible citizen so that the waste generated by him/her can be used to the maximum possible extent. It can also be used as part of a bigger solution for any city's (or smart city's) house-hold waste disposal problem.

3.
	What:
		We can start a survey of some sort to understand how aware and how much willing to pay is a person (living in slums of bangalore) for solving his/her own waste management problems. We currently are assuming that they don't want to pay anything because their default method is zero cost, in which they just throw their waste outside their own houses. We also assume that they have little to no knowledge about how harmful is the unmanaged waste for them, their children and the earth. Such a survey should also happen for people in other walks of life.
	How:
		Designing a survey (we do not have much expertise in this). Field visits.
	Why:
		This is give us a general understanding about the users we are dealing with. We can then evaluate the importance of incentivization and spreading awareness. It will also help us prune the solution space for the waste-disposal problem.

4. 
	What:
		In a pilot for households in a particular area - for example Koramangala or Seshadripuram or Shantinagar - where we incentivize people to give us all their waste and they will get something in return, we can monitor the amount and nature of waste that we get from each household.
	How:
		This might require making an app for the waste collectors (and maybe also for the people of that area to install). We will have different categories of waste and these will be collected seperately, and the waste producer will be paid for the amount of garbage that is supplied. We will obviously have to preserve the data for analysis - how much of what kind of waste at what time.
		We will want to collect everything that is useless for the household and find the best use of the same as well. 
	Why:
		To understand:
			a) Whether the household was already holding on to a lot of recyclable waste just in the hope of being able to dispose it off responsibly (like the case of Vivek). This can be seen as a spike in the amount of dry waste in the beginning of the period of pilot.
			b) Whether these households are getting motivated to not throw waste where they generate, and instead bring the waste back home to add to their own dustbins. This can be seen as a	gradual increase in the amount of dry waste, or a gradual increase in the rate at which the amount of dry waste increases (to account for the fact that their consumption is anyway either increasing or decreasing due to various other reasons).
			c) What is the appropriate frequency at which wet waste should be collected.
	
5. Smart bin technology. (Yet to do the back-ground work for this). We
first need to figure out the whole mapping of day-to-day waste to the
appropriate bin that should be used. Once this is prepared, we can
work on the following projects:

	a) Some people have already worked on and made incentive based
	public dustbins. One project can be to test its success.
	
	b) We can work on technology to come up with a design to
	reduce the cost of a hybrid dustbin which has one mouth and 3
	(or more) stomachs - wet, dry and hazardous, for household and
	public places' use.


==============================================================

We also have to find out mechanisms of testing how answering any of the projects above and completing any of the projects above solve our problem of city cleaning. We have to come up with metrics to measure impact and methods of measuring these metrics.
