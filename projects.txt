Project Ideas:

1. Finding out what BBMP currently does with all the waste it collects.

** Why:

BBMP asks its citizens to segregate their waste into dry and wet waste, but
the garbage trucks/autos that carry this waste rarely have any partitioning.
So we want to analyse what really happens to the waste collected by BBMP (at
least from one particular area). Our current assumption is that some amount of
the waste is being responsibly handled - as per the reports of the BBMP
website, but most of the waste is mixed upon collection from the producers and
then dumped in some nearby village.

** How

We can stick a GPS+GPRS stick to some samples of different kinds of wastes
(cardboards, papers, plastic, electronic, metal, glass ... and if possible even
to wet waste in some manner) and track their positions after the BBMP trucks
collect them.

================================================================================

2. Understanding what is the least a citizen should do with his/her waste. 

** Why:

A lot of people who actively look for responsible ways to manage their wastes
do not know how to do it properly. We need to know what is the minimum level of
segregation required for proper treatment of the waste and what piece of
garbage goes into which bin. 

** How:

We start with answering the following questions:
a) What is the best way of handling wet waste? Composting/bio-fuel/something else?
b) What level of segregation is ideal for dry waste?
c) How to handle hazardous waste?

** Remarks:

This experiment can help us design of a large trash can that can installed in a
local house-hold.
We decide an overall dimension of the bin based on weekly garbage production of
a general house, and make partitions on the basis of the answers to the above
questions and the general composition of the waste produced.

================================================================================

3. Understanding the mindset of the people

** Why:

We can then evaluate the importance of incentivization and spreading awareness. It
will also help us prune the solution space for the waste-disposal problem.

** How:

We can conduct a survey to understand how aware and how much
willing to pay is a person (living in slums of bangalore) for solving his/her
own waste management problems.

We currently are assuming that they don't want
to pay anything because their default method is zero cost, in which they just
throw their waste outside their own houses. We also assume that they have
little to no knowledge about how harmful is the unmanaged waste for them, their
children and the earth. Such a survey should also happen for people in other
walks of life.

================================================================================

4. Crowd-sourcing community cleanliness (based on Jay Chen's paper)

** Why:

There are a lot of people who all value community cleanliness to different extents, and hence are ready to pay different amounts for the same. There are also a lot of people who are ready to work on community cleanliness, but do not have enough incentives (mode of payment) to do so. If for any area, we can crowd-source the payment of the cleaners, we can create a marketplace for this demand and supply. The entire system to have a two thronged approach : collect residents who are voluntarily willing to contribute towards cleaning communal trash and organize waste pickers to communicate and negociate work/prices for a job.

** How:

Bill and Sudheesh are already working on a project called "the 3rd world", and they were trying to work alongside "The Ugly Indian" to implement payments for cleaners by philanthropists who can see these cleaners in actions. But in the case of the Ugly Indian, these cleaners are actually volunteers who really have other jobs and sources of income, and do not need the money. Instead, we can use the same platform to connect these philanthropist to cleaners who can clean these areas for money. In fact, we don't even need to rely on philanthropists. The worker can just record a video of him/herself cleaning, and the local community can pay for the job in a crowd-sourced fashion.

================================================================================

5. Understanding how people respond to interventions

** How:

In a pilot for households in a particular area - for example Koramangala or
Seshadripuram or Shantinagar - where we incentivize people to give us all their
waste and they will get money or credits in return, we can monitor the amount and
nature of waste that we get from each household.

This might require making an app for the waste collectors (and maybe also for
the people of that area). We will have different categories of waste
and these will be collected seperately, and the waste producer will be paid for
the amount of garbage that is supplied. We will obviously have to preserve the
data for analysis - *how much* of *what kind* of waste at *what time*.

We will want to collect everything that is useless for the household and find
the best use of the same as well. 

** Why:

To understand:
	a) Whether the household was already holding on to a lot of recyclable
waste just in the hope of being able to dispose it off responsibly (like the
case of Vivek). This can be seen as a spike in the amount of dry waste in the
beginning of the period of pilot.
	b) Whether these households are getting motivated to not throw waste where
they generate, and instead bring the waste back home to add to their own
dustbins. This can be seen as a	gradual increase in the amount of dry waste, or
a gradual increase in the rate at which the amount of dry waste increases (to
account for the fact that their consumption is anyway either increasing or
decreasing due to various other reasons).
	c) What is the appropriate frequency at which wet waste should be
collected.

================================================================================
	
6. Smart bin technology. (Yet to do the back-ground work for this). We
first need to figure out the whole mapping of day-to-day waste to the
appropriate bin that should be used. Once this is prepared, we can
work on the following projects:

	a) Some people have already worked on and made incentive based
	public dustbins. One project can be to test its success.
	
	b) We can work on technology to come up with a design to
	reduce the cost of a hybrid dustbin which has one mouth and 3
	(or more) stomachs - wet, dry and hazardous, for household and
	public places' use.


==============================================================

We also have to find out mechanisms of testing how answering any of the projects above and completing any of the projects above solve our problem of city cleaning. We have to come up with metrics to measure impact and methods of measuring these metrics.
